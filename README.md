ART is A machine learning Automated Recommendation Tool for guiding synthetic biology presented in the paper 
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18008-4

In this work, I have improved the pipeline through performing hyperparameter tuning to the machine learning models used in the original method.
The notebook shows the workflow of processing the data, training the model as well as provide recommendations of strain design to be experimented.
